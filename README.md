# JFK Assassination Video Processing
> This is an assignment from Computer Vision (CAP-5415)

The goal of this project is a study on crowd dynamics. We are looking to enhance relevant portions of the videos to offer insight into how many attendees were in attendance during the assassination of JFK. 

## Setup
Ensure Python's package installer (PIP) is installed on your machine. 

Open a terminal in the working directory (This is using a [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) terminal)

1. Create a virtual environment named `virtual_env`

```
python3 -m venv virtual_env
```

2. Activate the virtual environment
```
source virtual_env/bin/activate
```
> Note: You should now see your working directory prefixed by `(virtual_env)`


3. Install the `opencv` library using pip
```
pip install opencv-python
```
